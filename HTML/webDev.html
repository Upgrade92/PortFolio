            <h3>Analysis</h3>
            <p>                
                Analysis is the process of gathering and comparing information about the web 
                and its operation and use in order to improve the web's overall quality and to identify problem areas.            </p>

            <h3>Testing & Debugging</h3>
            <p>                
                Another skill Web Developers must have is the ability to validate code, 
                verify that it’s free of bugs, and fix any errors they may find. 
                Testing and debugging are time-consuming and often complicated; in fact, 
                a significant amount of a developer’s work hours is dedicated to the debugging process alone. 
                In some situations, code verification may be completed by a separate person; however, 
                it’s still vital for programmers to know how to check and debug their own code.

            <h3>Responisve web design</h3>
            <p>                
                Responsive design is an approach to web page creation that makes use of flexible layouts, 
                flexible images and cascading style sheet media queries. 
                The goal of responsive design is to build web pages that detect the visitor's screen size and orientation 
                and change the layout accordingly.

            <h3>Search engine optimisation</h3>
            <p>                
                When someone is conducting a Google search, it’s because they have a specific query 
                they’re hoping to find information about. And when your page shows up at the top of the search 
                results with that exact answer, they’re going to click over to your page.
                <br><br>
                While they may not convert right after discovering your website, they’re now aware 
                that they can come back to you if they have any other related questions. 
                This top-of-mind brand awareness is ideal for increasing conversions, 
                all because they were searching for something in your industry.

            <h3>Creativity</h3>
            <p>                
                As your website is the first thing people see, 
                the design is responsible for creating first impressions of the business 
                and can be a deciding factor for customers on whether you are the right partner for them.
                <br><br>
                A visually appealing website creates a positive image for your brand and an engaging experience for visitors, 
                encouraging them to spend more time on the website.
                On the flip side, an outdated website creates a negative first impression on your audience 
                and acts as a deterrent, driving potential customers away from your website and onto that of your competitors.            </p>
