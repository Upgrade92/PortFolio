            <h3>Identify needs</h3>
            <p>                
                Before you create any software, it's crucial to identify the needs of the issue at hand. 
                If a business wants to build software as a product for a wider audience, it can conduct a comprehensive 
                round of market research to know that what products customers need and want. Otherwise, 
                it may not be commercially viable. Depending on the project, the market research may take different
                forms to source the best data possible. That could include conducting customer surveys or investigating 
                the broader market to see what competition is already in place.

            <h3>Analyse the requirement</h3>
            <p>                
                After identifying the need, analyse the requirements to answer that need. 
                Draw up a specification or brief of what the developed software might look 
                and act like. From the basic specification, you may then establish a wider 
                list of tasks that to complete in the development stage. The more detail on 
                this, the better. Detail can help define the goals that the software may hit, 
                but also can help ensure that all individuals involved agree, right from the 
                beginning.

            <h3>Design</h3>
            <p>                
                Once you have created the specification for the entire project, it's then down 
                to software engineers and developers to draw up a more technical spec of what 
                they require to fulfil the larger project goals. Think about both the back end 
                of a piece of software and how it interacts with operating systems and the front 
                end. The front end is the user experience and how a user may interact with the 
                software. Having technicians to outline all the needs during the design stage 
                may ensure there is a smooth user flow in the final product.

            <h3>Develop and implement</h3>
            <p>                
                After the technical design phase, the first step in development is to write code and 
                programming based on the specification. Then you implement it into a company's IT systems 
                to see how it runs. There may often be a fair amount of bug fixing to do when the two ends 
                of the new software interact with one another. Use a testing environment for this implementation
                 phase to track and highlight any issues quickly and easily. This creates a pilot version of 
                 the software to match up against the original specification to see how closely it aligns with 
                 the original requirements.

        <div class="box">
            <h3>Test</h3>
            <p>                
                Testing is an imperative stage to carry out, even when the pilot version of software
                has left the test environment. You can use software testers alongside expert testers
                to ensure that the software answers the issue that initially needed solving. 
                It's crucial to set up a space where testers can be honest about their results. 
                This work environment can make it more comfortable to identify the true reviews of 
                a software's performance.
                <br><br>
                This also helps the team to deal with any corrective actions in a timely manner and 
                far more easily compared to rolling out the software at the pilot stage. 
                Continue testing until you eliminate all bugs in the software and it's running as 
                intended.

            <h3>Maintain</h3>
            <p>                
                It's important not to forget the final stage of developing software, 
                which is to maintain its relevance. After roll-out on a wider scale, 
                unforeseen issues may still arise. The software may not be as stable as 
                planned or the user experience may be more cumbersome than initially thought.
                <br><br>
                These are just two examples of what a software developer may resolve when trying 
                to maintain software to ensure that it works to the highest possible standard. 
                Some issues may be larger than others, while some may be a quick win. Either way, 
                it's essential for a software developer to take any minor or major bugs seriously 
                and rectify them as soon as possible.
