            <h3>Versatility</h3>
            <p>                
                Having a versatile database tool helps database teams increase productivity. 
                Database teams are typically tasked with maintaining an environment made up of diverse platforms.
                It's quite common for a DBA to interact with several different databases a day, 
                each of which has its idiosyncrasies.
                <br><br>
                Large environments often have a subset of DBAs who specialize in a particular platform, 
                but the majority of database professionals need to be versatile and able to work with multiple solutions.

            <h3>Centralised systems</h3>
            <p>                
                If your business is growing and you have staff to help you run it, 
                keeping track of the increasing amount of data can be tricky. 
                Good database systems can help you manage all your business-critical data centrally, 
                safely and securely - whenever you need it - to boost your chances of success.

            <h3>Managing Customer Data</h3>
            <p>                
                If customers are the lifeblood of your business, then a good customer relationship management (CRM) database should be at the heart of your growth plans. 
                Full-featured CRM databases are usually powerful enough to store and process everything, from customer contact details, 
                interaction history and accounts, to new prospects, leads and business opportunities. 
                Some CRM systems can even help you run and track marketing campaigns, such as email newsletters.

            <h3>Managing relationships</h3>
            <p>                
                A relational database is a collection of information that organizes data points 
                with defined relationships for easy access. In the relational database model, 
                the data structures -- including data tables, indexes and views -- remain separate from the physical storage structures, 
                enabling database administrators to edit the physical data storage without affecting the logical data structure.

            <h3>Data Security</h3>
            <p>                
                Why is Data Security important? 
                Data is a valuable asset that generates, acquires, saves, and exchanges for any company. 
                Protecting it from internal or external corruption and illegal access protects a company from financial loss, 
                reputational harm, consumer trust degradation, and brand erosion.

            <h3>Planning for growth</h3>
            <p>                
                Most business databases have some form of reporting capabilities - from analysing input data and productivity tracking, 
                to anticipating future trends and customers' needs. If you're planning a strategy for growth, 
                a robust database system can be your business' most valuable resource.
